  Hey there! Welcome!
</p>

<p> I am an oceanographer that discovered to be passionate about programming.</p>
<p>I joined several groups including Pyladies and last year's national conference organization (Python Brazil[12]).</p>
<p>I'm an open-source enthusiast and a living proof of the community's power and of what it can do for a person.</p>
<p>Although I am not originally from the computer sciences, I have a vast experience with data analysis programming scripts (specially with Matlab and Python) and a long 
experience working with multidisciplinary teams (such as biologists, engineers, 
managers, field workers, navy commanders, etc).</p>
<p>I've been working with web development during the past year till now and I am happy being a programmer. Also, I am dedicate and fast learning.   </p>
<p> I am crazy about books and, in particular the Chronicles of
Ice and Fire and all their theories. I like to write as much as I like to read. So, to help young passionate programmers, I write several blog posts to share my knowledge and my life experiences.</p>
<p> Now I am part of the awesome data science team of <a href="http://softplan.com.br" target="_blank">Softplan</a>.</p>
